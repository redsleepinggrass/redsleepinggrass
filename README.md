Hi. This is an alt account that is unlikely to see action because it is for safe, functional code that doesn't blow up in your face (purposefully or otherwise).
It may see some use if I finally find the motovation to write the code for the auto-deploying pan-and-tilt camera... thing... I am working on. If you are looking for my Space Engineers scripts, you're in the wrong place.
